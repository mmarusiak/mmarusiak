## Welcome, traveller!

My name is Marcel and I'm _game developer_. Kinda... I didn't make any game _yet_ but I have experience in Unity, Construct 2, JS and a bit of Python  and C++ programming, so let's hope I can call myself that way.

Now I'm focusing on my Unity project, mainly on open source tool for making dialogs in Unity a lot easier and faster.

As you can see my GitHub is almost empty, but not for long :cowboy_hat_face: :cowboy_hat_face: :cowboy_hat_face:

*PS. During school year expect less activity from me. (School year lasts from september to middle of june). During that time, probably commits will be more about details and small changes (markdowns, comments, etc.), but I will do my best to keep working on my projects.*
