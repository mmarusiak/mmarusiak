## Hello there!

**_Indie Game Developer | Student | Big Lego fan_**

My name is Marcel and I'm _game developer_. Kinda... I didn't make any game _yet_ but I have experience in Unity, C#. Construct 2, JS and a bit of Python  and C++ programming, so let's hope I can call myself that way.

As you can see my GitHub is almost empty, but not for long :cowboy_hat_face: :cowboy_hat_face: :cowboy_hat_face: 

Now working on [*Universe Simulator*](https://github.com/mmarusiak/Universe-Simulator).

*PS. During school year expect less activity from me. (School year lasts from september to middle of june). Anyway I'll do my best to mentain as active as possible during that time.*
