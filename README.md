## Hello there! 👋

**_Entry level programmer 👨🏻‍💻 | Uni Student 👨🏻‍🎓_**

I'm a student at University of Technology in Wrocław (WRUST). I'm technology enthusiast, I love solving problems which I do a lot while programming. Outside of study, I make video games and many interesting stuff which I host on my github and contribute to a lot of interesting open-source projects.
