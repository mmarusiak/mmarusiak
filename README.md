## Hello there! 👋

**_Entry level programmer 👨🏻‍💻 | Uni Student 👨🏻‍🎓_**

I'm a student at the University of Technology in Wrocław (WUST) with a strong passion for technology. I love solving problems, especially through programming, which I do frequently. Outside of my studies, I create video games and work on various exciting projects, many of which I host on my GitHub. Additionally, I actively contribute to a variety of open-source projects.
